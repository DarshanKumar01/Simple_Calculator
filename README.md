# calculator using js, Html,Css

A simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a project that involves creating a basic calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The HTML code sets up the structure and layout of the calculator interface, while CSS is used for styling and formatting the calculator's appearance. JavaScript code handles the arithmetic operations when buttons are clicked, and the result is displayed on the screen. This project is a great way to practice your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while building a practical application that can be used for everyday calculations.
